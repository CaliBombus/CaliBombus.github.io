### Bee genetics

Coming soon! 

For now, check out some stuff I've written about my research on [bumble bee movement](../bbmove). 

You can also check out my github repository which contains a flowchart for how to use RADseq data with the program COLONY and hopefully also other helpful scripts. It's a work in progress. Please contact me if you need help with anything. https://github.com/John-Mola/SNPs_to_COLONY
